# Wallpaper Boi
Wallpaper Boi is a tool I have created to be used at my academic institution due to the fact that wallpaper switching has been disabled. It started as a simple wallpaper overlayer, but I have then added further features such as being able to use images with transparency (although it's a bit cheaty because Progman/WorkerW-level windows don't support transparency).

I understand that the code is an utter mess (although I am working to rectify that), but that is because the baseline for this was created during a single class break (about 30 minutes).
## Uses
This tool can currently do the following:
* Overlay the wallpaper even if wallpaper changing was disabled on admin-level
* Overlay transparent PNGs atop the wallpaper, maintaining the original wallpaper underneath it (don't rely on this in all cases, it takes a screenshot of the background)
* Overlay an animated gif atop the wallpaper
## How to use
Place the desired wallpaper into the Pictures folder on your computer, name it wallpaperoverride, and then run the application. 
The application does not automatically start with Windows, you need to do that yourself if you want it.
